# Tabular Data Augmentation using Diffusion Models

Master's Graduation Project (SEDS500)

## Overview

This project explores diffusion-based generative models for tabular data augmentation. The goal is to implement and evaluate methods that can generate realistic synthetic tabular data to augment existing datasets.

## Background

Tabular data augmentation is challenging because:
- Mixed data types (continuous, categorical, ordinal)
- Complex feature dependencies
- No spatial/sequential structure to exploit (unlike images/text)

Diffusion models have recently shown promising results in this domain.

## Key Papers

1. **TabDDPM** - Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for tabular data
2. **STaSy** - Score-based Tabular data Synthesis
3. **TabSyn** - Tabular data Synthesis with diffusion models
