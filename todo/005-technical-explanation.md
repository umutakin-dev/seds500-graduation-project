# Technical Explanation for Report

**Source:** Planning session

## Task

Formalize the technical explanation of diffusion models for the project report.

## Notes

- We have `notebooks/01_diffusion_explained.ipynb` as a tutorial-style explanation
- The report needs a more formal/academic framing
- Should cover:
  - What is a diffusion model?
  - Forward process (adding noise)
  - Reverse process (denoising)
  - Training objective (noise prediction)
  - Why diffusion for tabular data?

## Reference Materials

- Notebook: `notebooks/01_diffusion_explained.ipynb`
- Concepts doc: `docs/concepts.md`
- Paper analysis: `docs/paper-analysis.md`

## Status
- [ ] Not started
